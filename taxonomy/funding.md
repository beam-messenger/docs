# Funding
Any company is beholden to those that pay them for their product, and messengers are no different. How a messenger is funded informs the design decisions you can expect them to make and the direction you can expect them to evolve. We identify five major funding sources:
* Paid tiers
* Data mining
* Community contributions
* Corporate partners
* Advertising

## Paid Tiers
The most straightforward way to make money is to sell it. Because of the high availability of free messengers as well as low quality messengers, users want to at least try a messenger before paying for it. For this reason, messengers usually offer a free tier with some features and one or more paid tiers with more features. The messenger market is competitive, so usually most of the features are available for free, with just a few features like teams and on-premise deployments being reserved for paid tiers.

Because open source products can be deployed for free, the best you can hope for from a messenger that charges money is an open source client.

## Data Mining
Companies can also profit off messengers with data mining, where they collect user data to drive other products or sell it to other companies. By knowing who you talk to and what about, companies can target ads better. They can also use your conversations to train models that predict your next word for keyboards. Don't expect these messengers to be open source.

## Community Contributions
Fully open source messengers are generally funded by community contributions, in terms of both money and labor. Engineers building the product are building it on their own time out of their own passion or are paid by contributions from users who could use the messenger for free. Purely community-funded projects tend to lack the polish and features of their better-funded counterparts.

## Corporate Partners
Occassionally, open source messengers will be funded by corporations that want to have a bigger stake in the platform e.g. a cryptocurrency that wants the messenger to integrate a wallet for their currency.

## Advertising
A few messengers profit by displaying ads in their clients, but this is unpopular with users. These clients can't be open source because you could modify them to not display ads, and without being able to guarantee anything about their security, they don't have anything going for them compared with other messengers.
