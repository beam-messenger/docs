# Features
The features of a messenger are what affects users the most, alongside its general polish. There are some wondefully polished and full-featured messengers, but once you're interested in security, the landscape becomes more sparse. Security requirements make some features hard or impossible to implement and the difficulty of funding open source development doesn't help. Here are some features we pay attention to in messengers:
* Cross-platform support
* Image and file sharing
* Audio and video calling
* Teams
* Search

## Cross Platform Support
Supporting more platforms is better, including Android, iOS, web, Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

## Image And File Sharing
Sharing images is a basic messenger feature. Sharing files seems like it should be just as basic, but it sometimes isn't supported.

## Audio And Video Calling
Internet calling makes for higher-quality calls than standard cell phone calls, especially over wifi. Video calling is a natural extension.

## Teams
Some messengers let users form teams. Teams contain multiple named group conversations that team members can search, join, and leave freely. Team support is the main feature that makes a messenger suitable for business use.

## Search
Being able to quickly search for messages is another feature that's especially helpful for business. Search becomes harder when messages are encrypted and the server can't index them.
